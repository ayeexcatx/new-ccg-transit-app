- React
- Vite
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- Lucide Icons

- API services
- Entity filtering and sorting
- Serverless function execution (Deno)
- Connector-based integrations (for example Google Drive sync)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Base44 Entities #
** The application expects the following Base44 entities to exist: **
1. AccessCode
2. Announcement
3. AppConfig
4. Company
5. CompanyAvailabilityDefault
6. CompanyAvailabilityOverride
7. Confirmation
8. Dispatch
9. DispatchTemplateNotes
10. Driver
11. DriverDispatch
12. General
13. IncidentReport
14. IncidentUpdate
15. Notification
16. TimeEntry
** These entities are not included in the GitHub repository. **
** They must exist in the connected Base44 application. **
---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dispatch Filtering Logic#

1. Dispatch visibility is determined using a combination of:
- Company association
- Truck assignments
- Driver assignments
- Dispatch status
- Archive state
2. Typical filtering behavior:
| Role          | Dispatch visibility                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Admin         | All dispatches                                 |
| Company Owner | Dispatches assigned to company trucks          |
| Driver        | Dispatches assigned through driver assignments |

# Core Workflows #

** Dispatch Creation **
1. Admin creates a dispatch
2. Dispatch is assigned to one or more trucks
3. Truck users receive the dispatch in their portal
4. Trucks confirm assignment
5. Drivers perform work
6. Time entries are logged
7. Dispatch is archived once complete

** Dispatch Confirmation **
Truck users confirm assignments through the dispatch portal.
Confirmations are tracked in the Confirmation entity.


** Time Entry Logging **
Drivers or truck users log operational time entries tied to dispatches.
Entries are stored in the TimeEntry entity.

** Incident Reporting **
Incidents can be created by multiple roles and linked to dispatches.
Incident updates maintain an event history.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recent Refactor Summary (March 2026)

Purpose: improve maintainability and reduce duplication.

There were no intended behavior changes.

Key systems stabilized:
- notifications
- dispatch lifecycle
- confirmations
- SMS logic
- visibility rules
- deep-link handling

> ⚠️ Future changes to these systems should reference:
> - `docs/refactor-safety-rules.md`
> - baseline docs in `/docs`


---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recent Behavior Reconciliation (2026-03-31)

- **Shared dispatch drawer actions now differ by role:**
  - Admin top action row includes **Back**, **Edit**, **Report Incident**, and **Screenshot**.
  - Company Owner top action row includes **Back**, **Report Incident**, and **Screenshot Dispatch**.
  - Driver top action row includes **Back** and **Report Incident** only.
- **Admin in-place drawer overlay is enabled** from admin entry points (Notifications page, notification bell, Confirmations, Incidents) using `AdminDispatchDrawerContext`; admins no longer need to route through `AdminDispatches` first to open dispatch detail from those pages.
- **Back button semantics in admin overlay:** label stays **Back**, but it closes the overlay and keeps the admin on the same underlying page.
- **Staggered truck times/details are supported** through optional `Dispatch.truck_overrides` (`start_time`, `start_location`, `instructions`, `notes`), with effective per-truck fallback to base dispatch fields.
- **Live Board start-time precedence** for each truck line is: truck override start time -> earliest assignment start time for that truck -> dispatch `start_time`.
- **Notification/SMS start-time wording is truck-aware:** when a notification target truck scope resolves to one effective start time, that time is injected; when multiple times exist, wording intentionally avoids presenting a single misleading time.
- **Drive/HTML dispatch records are truck-aware** and reflect effective truck override values in per-truck records where those fields differ from base dispatch values.
