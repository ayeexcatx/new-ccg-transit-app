# **App Baseline – Global Access & Admin Dashboard**

---

## Change log (2026-03-28)
- **Added:** Clarified authenticated Base44 sign-in as the gate before access-code linking.
- **Removed:** Outdated wording that implied access code by itself is the full authentication step.
- **Edited:** Login/landing wording in app entry and company-owner login sections to match current linking flow.

## **1\. Application Entry (Login Page)**

* Navigating to **app.ccgnj.com** (desktop or mobile) first follows the Base44 authenticated sign-in gate, then lands in the in-app **Access Code Login** linking screen
* Users enter a valid **access code** to link their authenticated user identity to an app role/session
* **Mobile behavior:** A popup appears suggesting the user install the app, including instructions
* **Desktop behavior:** No install prompt is shown

---

## **2\. Admin User Flow**

* Logging in as an **Admin** routes the user to the **Admin Dashboard** by default

---

## **3\. Global Header (All Pages)**

* A **persistent header** is displayed across all pages and does not change
* **Left side:**
  * Company logo
  * Line 1: Company name
    * Admin → always “CCG Transit”
    * Company Owner → their company name
    * Driver → their assigned company
  * Line 2: Workspace identity label (usually user name). For Admin view this is shown as `Name (Admin)`; company owner/driver/truck views show role-specific identity labels without exposing internal workspace fields.
  * Note: added after code-backed review (2026-03-24).
* **Right side:**
  * Notification bell
  * Menu button (contains Profile)
  * Logout button
